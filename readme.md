#XBMC Fan Edit Scraper

This add-on is designed to scrape information about movie fan projects, including fan edits, custom DVDs, extended editions, documentaries, preservations, restorations, and workprints.

##Source

Information is scraped from [fanedits.com](http://fanedits.com/).

    Currently in beta, fanedits.com is an online fan project database with the goal of featuring all film projects produced by fans. This may include traditional fan edits, film preservation efforts, custom and fan-made DVDs, and fan films and documentaries. 

    Fanedits.com is now hosted by originaltrilogy.com.

The were three reasons for choosing to use [fanedits.com](http://fanedits.com/)/[originaltrilogy.com](http://originaltrilogy.com/) over the larger [fanedit.org](http://fanedit.org):

1. fanedits.com's data is more consistently structured, making it easier to scrape.
2. fanedits.com is user-editable, so it can be easily updated by the community.
3. fanedits.com lists types of fan projects that fanedit.org doesn't cover, including custom DVDs and preservations.

Despite these points, fanedit.org is still an amazing resource. Ideally it will be added as a secondary source of information at some point.
